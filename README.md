# Simon Game

In this project i decided to do a regular/smegular Simon game. It is a memory game where you have to follow the sequence and copy the sequence correctly to move on to
the next level. I decided to have 2 modes in this game, regular and strict. The medium mode is pretty straight forward. When a coloured button flashes, you click
on the button. When you get futher on in the game you will have several colours to rememeber in order. As for the 
strict mode, you have to start from the beginning. For the design of the game i decided i wanted to have a big circle as the game board and 4 coloured buttons all around inside
the big for the sequence. In this middle of the game board i have put a smaller circle with the control buttons in. This way the user can always see what level
they are, on as well as being able to change the mode, start and restart the game. I decided to use rgby for the buttons as i thought they
would stand for brightness.

I was given the variables, and i built my game around that.
this is just practice for myself. thank you for trying it out NERDS

### Credits

I have used the website [myFreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/beaucarnes/simon-game) for research in creating the game. I needed an understanding
of what to expect my game too look like and how it would work and reworked code around that. using different iterations to deepen my understanding.
